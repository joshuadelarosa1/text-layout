This mini project implements text blocks in many different ways. For example,
the user can center a text block or right justify it if they would like. It
also includes some methods to test for equality of two different blocks (all 
three being different types of equalitiy.)

Sam Rebelsky's starter code and also guidence on some of the classes

I talked through some of the implmentations with Alma Ordaz and how
to actually manipulate the text blocks to reach the desired goal.
